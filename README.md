# Citus Nightly Docker image creation

The single purpose of this branch is to create and update nightly images. We trigger DockerHub builds daily to update `latest`, `alpine` , and `nightly` images everyday.

## Note:
If we see fit, we can update the image creation workflow on Docker Hub, and this branch will keep updating all the images. To access the list of current builds, check Docker Hub build rules.
